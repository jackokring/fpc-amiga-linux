## musts or essentials
./ security as window
sudo as GUI
task as view menu for selection of "roll"?
escapes/immediates/compiles
non embeddable control codes
builtins
export formats with ins a literals and outs as # literals
continuation execution?
GUI proxies fn key macros?
multi output interleave based on selections
notification interface
queries as environmentals?
archives as compact serializables
signs verifies as seen locking
observers as view based detection of happens for notifications and "HERE" operators
signed operator script execute policy for ring including ring NUL
messaging such as "Code X requires elevation to run. Signed YYYY. Y/N?"
also messaging like "Code X ws on the stack in error. Trace/demote YYYY. Y/N?"
built outs and alts maintainance list
datatime and fingerprint based ./ and others for install independance of date
wider cards? synced tupling and sub selects

## in minds
primary multi dimensional labelled dataset
continuous update sunchronous locking of tasked AI, models
easy aux procurement of various complex CLI tools such as Mathematica dev free
representation of control embeddables
cloud git saves for pull instance re-remoting
ssh logons password kinda auto key
demux junctions of SIMD style commands
sychronous wait for start on file close (auto &)
protection ring obvious parse compile/execution violation detection
referer invoker DB sign advisories and auth coalates
